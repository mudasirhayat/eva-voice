mono_1.wav,"Okay, fresh start. How about this? Closer eyes for a second. Imagine a world made entirely of sand, golden, shimmering sand that stretches as far as the eye can see. In this world, there's a tiny village made of polished shells. And in that village lives a little Samcrab named Pip. Kip dreams of exploring the world beyond his village, but everyone tells him it's too dangerous. Bunday Pip finds an old, chipped compass. He knows that compass holds the key to his adventure. What happens next? Should we let Pip follow his dreams?"
mono_2.wav,"All right, where was I? Ah, yes, the crimson sun. So these aliens, they had iridescent skin that rippled with every thought. And they spoke in harmonies rather than words."
mono_3.wav,"If Pip's bouncing off the shell walls with excitement, he probably wouldn't wait for a mapper hidden tunnels. Mm-hmm. He probably grabbed that compass, yell see ya to the other crabs, and scare rad into the sand dunes as fast as his little legs could carry him."
mono_4.wav,"Love blooms in the strangest places, right? I bet Pat never expected to find the same crowd with his dreams in the middle of a sandstorm. But maybe he does. Or maybe he finds a love as stubborn and adventurous as he is. Someone who appreciates a good mystery and isn't afraid to get a little sand in her gild. Where do you see them meeting? Hmm?"
